# Monarchy

Monarchy is a fork of Omarchy, specialized for my needs.

[Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) is an awesome project, initiated by DHH from [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/).  

If you are interested in the initial setup, you can take a look at it [here](https://youtu.be/I5Mnni7cea8).

## Initiative of Omarchy

Turn a fresh Arch installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system based on Hyprland by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omarchy (like it was for Omakub). No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omarchy is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.
